				<p class="my-2 py-2 mt-2 pt-2">HUGO GALERIE is a fine art gallery in New York City specializing in contemporary figurative painting and sculpture. HUGO GALERIE is passionate about the contemporary relevance of traditional, artistic methods. HUGO GALERIE’s artists demonstrate the timelessness of classical techniques and how their representational practices remain evergreen when powered by current sensibilities and perspectives. Whether bulls or flowers, architectural scenes or lush landscapes, portraits or interiors, the paintings and sculptures exhibited at HUGO GALERIE continue to refresh the familiar.</p>
<p class="my-2 py-2 mt-2 pt-2">
HUGO GALERIE represents an international roster of artists working in a variety of media: canvas, linen, and board support oil paint, encaustic, pastel, watercolor, acrylic paint, collage, and marble powder, while sculptures are crafted from bronze, resin, and plaster. HUGO GALERIE’s artists are innovative in not only their media, but also their genres; they work in representational styles that include realism, magical realism, impressionism, and surrealism. The artists are based across Canada, France, Italy, Malta, Slovenia, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States; their works can be found in private and museum collections around the world.</p>

Reco Sturgis, founder of HUGO GALERIE, was previously director of Axelle Fine Arts Galerie in SoHo. Axelle was founded in 1998 by Bertrand Delacroix and established itself as a crucial part of the New York City art scene for nearly two decades. After Delacroix’s passing in 2015, Axelle permanently closed. HUGO GALERIE aims to keep Delacroix’s legacy alive and continue the Axelle tradition.</p>
